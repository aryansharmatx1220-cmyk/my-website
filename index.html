    <h1>The Midnight Train</h1>

    <p>It was a foggy night in <strong>Shimla</strong>, and the old railway station was almost deserted. Aryan had missed the last train back home and decided to wait in the small, dimly lit waiting hall. The wooden benches creaked under his weight as he tried to ignore the strange silence.</p>

    <p>Minutes passed—or maybe hours. He wasn’t sure. That’s when he noticed the <strong>old clock on the wall ticking backward</strong>, its hands moving in reverse. A cold chill ran down his spine.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a <strong>train whistle</strong> echoed through the station, though no train was supposed to arrive. Aryan turned, expecting to see an empty platform—but instead, a faint <strong>shadow of a train appeared</strong>, with lights glowing weakly through the fog. The train doors slid open, inviting him in.</p>

    <p>Against all logic, Aryan felt <strong>drawn toward it</strong>. Inside, the carriage was old-fashioned, like it had been stuck in the 1920s. The seats were empty, except for one: a <strong>small boy staring silently</strong>, his eyes hollow.</p>

    <p>Aryan took the seat opposite him, and the train jolted forward. The windows showed familiar scenes of Shimla, but distorted—the streets twisted unnaturally, houses warped, shadows moving in impossible ways.</p>

    <p>The boy whispered:<br>
    <em>"Do you want to see what happens next?"</em></p>

    <p>Aryan tried to speak, but his voice wouldn’t come. The train suddenly stopped at a <strong>station he recognized—his own hometown—but everything felt wrong, darker, colder.</strong></p>

    <p>On the platform, he saw a <strong>figure wearing his own face</strong>, waving him to get off. Heart racing, he stepped down. The world around him seemed normal again, the fog gone, the clock ticking forward—but something felt off.</p>

    <p>Aryan turned a corner and saw the <strong>Shimla railway station</strong> looming in the distance, exactly as it had been that first night. And then he realized—the train never left.</p>

    <p>He was back.</p>

    <p>The <strong>foggy night. The empty waiting hall. The backward clock.</strong></p>

    <p>He sat down on the creaking bench. The train whistle echoed again.</p>

    <p><strong>And the loop began.</strong></p>
